The letting agent has a duty of care to the tenant, and may be able to help to resolve issues depending on the service type the landlord has with the agent. Look at your \u0027Welcome letter\u0027 to find out the service level of your landlord. Alternatively, a tenant can find independent advice from The Citizens Advice Bureau."
